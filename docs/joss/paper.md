# Summary

Sparse matrices are widely applicable in data analysis while the theory of 
matrix processing is well-established. There are a wide range of algorithms for 
basic operations such as matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication, 
factorization, etc. To facilitate data analysis, tools, such as `GraphBLAS API`, 
provide a set of building blocks and allows for reducing algorithms to sparse
linear algebra operations. While GPGPU utilization for high-performance linear 
algebra is common, the high complexity of GPGPU programming makes the implementation 
of the complete set of sparse operations on GPGPU challenging. Thus, it is worth
to address this problem by focusing on a basic by still important case â€” sparse Boolean algebra.

# Statement of need

`SPbLA` is a sparse Boolean linear algebra primitives and operations
for GPGPU computations. It comes as stand-alone self-sufficient 
library with C API for high-performance computing with multiple backends
for NVIDIA CUDA, OpenCL and CPU-only platforms. The library is shipped
with PyPI `pyspbla` package [@pyspbla] for work within Python runtime. 
The primary library primitive is a sparse matrix of boolean values. The library 
provides the most popular operations for matrix manipulation, such as 
construction from values, transpose, sub-matrix extraction, matrix-to-vector 
reduce, matrix-matrix element-wise addition, multiplication and Kronecker product.  

The primary goal of the `SPbLA` is the implementation, testing and profiling
algorithms for solving data analysis problems, such as RDF analysis [@article:cfpq_and_rdf_analysis], 
bioinformatics [@article:rna_prediction], static code analysis of C and 
Java programs [@article:dyck_cfl_code_analysis] and evaluation of regular and 
CFL-reachability queries [@inproceedings:matrix_cfpq; @inbook:kronecker_cfpq_adbis]. 

Also we hope, that the library is a small step to move forward the implementation of 
the fully featured sparse linear algebra with generalization to arbitrary
monoids and searings for multi-GPU computations.

# Related tools

`GraphBLAS API` [@paper:graphblas_foundations] is one of the first standards, that
formalize the mathematical building blocks in the form of the programming interface
for implementing algorithms in the language of the linear algebra. 
`SuiteSparse` [@article:suite_sparse_for_graph_problems] is a reference implementations
of the `GraphBLAS API` for CPU computation. It is mature and fully featured library
with number of bindings for other programming languages, such `pygraphblas` [@pygraphblas] 
for Python programming.

GPGPU utilization for data analysis and for linear algebra operations is a promising 
way to high-performance data analysis because GPGPU is much more powerful in parallel
data processing. However, GPGPU programming is still challenging.
Best to our knowledge, the is no complete GraphBLAS API implementation for GPGPU
computations, except `GraphBLAST` [@yang2019graphblast], which is currently in the
active development. Some work is also done to move SuiteSparse forward GPGPU computations.

The sparsity of data introduces issues with load balancing, irregular data access, 
thus sparsity complicates the implementation of high-performance algorithms for 
sparse linear algebra on GPGPU even more. There is number of open-source libraries,
which implement independently different sparse formats and operations.
Thus, there are no sparse linear algebra libraries based on the state-of-the-art algorithms.
Libraries such as `cuSPARSE` [@net:cusparse_docs], `bhSPARSE` [@10.1016/j.jpdc.2015.06.010], 
`clSPARSE` [@10.1145/2909437.2909442] and `CUSP` [@net:cusplibrary] have limited type 
and operators customization features with major focus on numerical types only.
